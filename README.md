# Fernet Kotlin

A Kotlin implementation of the [Fernet spec](https://github.com/fernet/spec).

Fernet allows you to easily generate and verify HMAC based authentication tokens for issuing API requests between remote servers. It also encrypts the message so it can be used to transmit secure data over the wire.
